MaRtin's R CouRse 5th edition. Fall 2019: An introduction to R programming and text mining.

This is the course material for the fifth edition of the R course by MaRtin, designed for UDEM students. In case I edit this course material (extensions, new sections, amended codes and even corrections for English grammar) then the most updated version will be located here at https://github.com/mlozanoqf/CouRse5ed

You have to download all files into a directory to be able to run the rmd file. If you cannot run the rmd file, then you probably do not have the MiKTeX full version and R markdown package. In any case, the PDF file is the compilation of all files. So, you can consider the PDF file as your main course material file.
